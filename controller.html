    Hi!
    <p>Couple of questions for you.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Does Facebook own your friends?</li>
      <li>Do you think Facebook owns the data about your friends, such as their 
          email, their website, their IM name, etc. that they made public for you
          to see?
      </li>
      <li>Do you think your Facebook friends would mind if you, oh, we don't know,
          decided one day to email them, or visit their website? How about add them
          to your address book on your phone?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you answered "no" to the above questions, we can help you get your friends'
      contact info out of Facebook. We can export the info to your Google Contacts 
      (GMail), among other things!
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, this extension is open source. You can fork it now on GitHub!

        <h1>NOTICE</h2>
        <p>Facebook doesn't like it when we visit our friends alot. And if visit 
        a couple of friends, lets say ~60 profiles an hour, then Facebook purposely
        removes the textual email from our friends profile! Even if they want us to 
        see it! </p>
        <p>But they will allow us enjoy to enjoy seeing our friends email address
        in 30 minutes, when they are done messing around. We wil be taking a break 
        since we do not want Facebook to be mad at us since we love our friends.</p>
        <p>Feel free to export your friends now! Don't worry, you can resume fetching
        in an hour, and everything is cached, so it will start where you left off :)</p>
