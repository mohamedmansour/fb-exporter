    Hi!
    <p>Couple of questions for you.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Does Facebook own your friends?</li>
      <li>Do you think Facebook owns the data about your friends, such as their 
          email, their website, their IM name, etc. that they made public for you
          to see?
      </li>
      <li>Do you think your Facebook friends would mind if you, oh, we don't know,
          decided one day to email them, or visit their website? How about add them
          to your address book on your phone?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you answered "no" to the above questions, we can help you get your friends'
      contact info out of Facebook. We can export the info to your Google Contacts 
      (GMail), among other things!
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, this extension is open source. You can fork it now on GitHub!

      THIS CHROME EXTENSION IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK. HERE IS A LINK
      TO THE FACEBOOK <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">TERMS OF SERVICE</a>.

    <p> 
      <input type="checkbox" id="tos">I have read the Terms of Service.</a> 
      <button class="tos-guarded continue1" disabled="true">Let's get started!</button>

  </div>
  <!-- 
    STEP 2:
      Let the user fetch all their friend!.
   -->
  <div class="bubble" id="step2">
    <p> Fetching friend list... done.  See below.</p>
    <p> These are all the frends that will be exported, 
        <button id="start-crunching">let's start!</button>
        <button id="delete-cache">delete cache!</button>

  <!-- 
    STEP 3:
      Start processing all friends by visiting their profile. And taking note
      of thier data like their email and phone number that they want to share
      with you.
   -->
  <div class="bubble" id="step3">
    <p> Fetching friend details... this could take a while, especially if you're
        really popular!</p>
    <p> <span class="hilite">IMPORTANT:</span> Please don't touch your Facebook tab
    until we're done, thanks!  If you really <strong>must</strong> have your
    Facebook fix <em>right now</em>, <a target="_blank"

  <!-- 
    STEP 4:
      Choose the friends that you want to export to your external contact manager.
   -->
  <div class="bubble" id="step4">
    <p>All done!  Please check the list below. Uncheck the friends you want to skip.</p>
    <p>Now the fun part!  Pick an export button below, and we'll get started
       copying your friend data there!</p>
    <ul id="export-methods">
      <li class="export-method">
        <input type="image" src="/img/gmail-logo.jpg" id="export-to-gmail" width="60" />
        This will log you into your GMail account, and import your Facebook friend data
        into your Contacts.  We'll create a group in your GMail contacts called
        <span class="hilite">"Imported from Facebook"</span> and we'll avoid
        duplicating any existing contacts.
      </li>
      <li class="export-method">
        <input type="image" src="/img/csv-icon.gif" id="export-to-csv" />
        This will export your contacts as a CSV file.

        <h1>NOTICE</h2>
        <p>Facebook doesn't like it when we visit our friends alot. And if visit 
        a couple of friends, lets say ~60 profiles an hour, then Facebook purposely
        removes the textual email from our friends profile! Even if they want us to 
        see it! </p>
        <p>But they will allow us enjoy to enjoy seeing our friends email address
        in 30 minutes, when they are done messing around. We wil be taking a break 
        since we do not want Facebook to be mad at us since we love our friends.</p>
        <p>Feel free to export your friends now! Don't worry, you can resume fetching
        in an hour, and everything is cached, so it will start where you left off :)</p>
